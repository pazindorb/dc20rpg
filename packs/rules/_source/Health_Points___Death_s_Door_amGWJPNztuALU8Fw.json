Lighter hits might graze you, while bigger hits knock you off your feet. The description and roleplay of how damage is taken can change depending on its source and the situation, but Health Points represent how much of a beating you can take before you die.</p>",

This is represented in whatever way the player wants to describe this state looks like for their character. They are NOT unconscious, they are in a heavily weakened state about to die if something is not done SOON! They could be prone crawling on the ground, holding themselves up with their sword, or spitting out blood as they hold on for dear life.</p><p id=\"1cf1b90a-e081-8107-b172-fa6cc9f07483\">If your Death’s Door Threshold is -3 HP and you take a large enough hit while you’re low on HP that reduces you to -3 or lower… you are instantly dead. If you have 1 HP and get hit for 4 damage… you die. This means that PCs should avoid getting to low HP against fearsome enemies at all costs, using healing magic, class features, or consumables… like you SHOULD be doing already anyway!</p><p id=\"1cf1b90a-e081-81ac-a72a-faae572a9047\">\n</p>",
