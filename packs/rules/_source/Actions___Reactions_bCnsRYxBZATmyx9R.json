When that happens, you can choose to wait until just the right moment by Holding your Action. To Hold your Action, you must declare an Action you want to take and state a Trigger. Once you do so, you can’t change the Action or Trigger.</p><p id=\"1cf1b90a-e081-8179-88b6-e7843f56fdd1\"><em><strong>Declare Action:</strong></em><em><strong> </strong></em>When you declare the Action, you must immediately spend the Action Points required to take that Action. The Multiple Check Penalty from this turn applies to any Checks you make as part of this Reaction. </p><p id=\"1cf1b90a-e081-8147-81b8-f07ce9a0e6bf\"><em><strong>State Trigger:</strong></em><em><strong> </strong></em>The Trigger must be an observable event, such as “I want to wait until an enemy moves into range to make an Attack against them”, “I want to wait until I see my ally get out of range before I shoot the barrel filled with explosives”, or something else.</p><p id=\"1cf1b90a-e081-81a1-bf15-f132eea9f3d1\"><em><strong>Take Reaction:</strong></em> If the stated Trigger occurs at any time before the start of your next turn, you can take the declared Action as a Reaction. If the Reaction requires you to spend any additional resources (such as Stamina Points or Mana Points) you spend them now. Your Reaction interrupts the events stated in the Trigger, allowing you to act before the events resolve. If the Trigger never occurs, then the declared Action can’t be taken and the AP spent is wasted. </p><p id=\"1cf1b90a-e081-81d3-b5bc-e19a0c779acb\" class=\"block-color-blue_background\"><strong>Example: </strong>It’s your turn and you have <strong>2 AP</strong> remaining to spend, but you really want to work together with an ally. You tell the GM that you want to spend <strong>2 AP</strong> on Held Actions. You declare that you will be taking the Move Action and the Attack Action and you spend <strong>2 AP</strong> right now. You also state the Trigger for these Held Actions is “your ally is in melee range of an enemy”. Once the Trigger occurs you take those 2 Actions immediately. You take a Move Action to move to the creatures and then you make an Attack Action on a creature. If the creatures are too far away for 1 Move Action (1 AP), then you would only be able to move as far as you can and the Attack Action (1 AP) is wasted since you were not close enough to make an Attack. You can’t convert the 1 AP spent on the Attack Action into another Move Action, since that’s not what you declared.</p><p id=\"1cf1b90a-e081-81f0-872a-d6ad0f8ccf82\" class=\"block-color-purple_background\"><strong>DC Tip: </strong>PCs can set triggers to be something less specific like, “I’m going to shoot an arrow at the next enemy I see.” Just make sure the PC and the GM are on the same page on what the intent of what they’re wanting to do is for their Reactions Trigger.</p>",

The GM decides if that makes sense.</p><p id=\"1cf1b90a-e081-8155-b5d2-c70377ad24cf\" class=\"block-color-purple_background\"><strong>DC Tip:</strong> You are not actually casting this Spell as stated in its description, you are instead using the “flavor” of the Spell to be how you initiate the Spell Duel. The only part of the Spell’s mechanics that matter is its Range and/ or Area of Effect.</p><p id=\"1cf1b90a-e081-81a9-81d0-fa083120f058\"><em><strong>Targeted:</strong></em> If your chosen Spell targets 1 or more creatures or objects, you must be able to target the opposing creature or any of its targets with your Spell.</p><p id=\"1cf1b90a-e081-8120-9a04-c5b4fd109ecc\"><em><strong>Area of Effect:</strong></em><em><strong> </strong></em>If your chosen Spell covers an area (such as an Arc, Cone, Cube, Cylinder, Line, or Sphere), then your Spell’s Area of Effect must include the opposing creature, any of its targets, or cover an area between the opposing creature and any of its targets.</p><p id=\"1cf1b90a-e081-814d-8d8e-cfc3b9e00d43\"><em><strong>Success &amp; Failure: </strong></em>The success and failure statements of your Spell are replaced by the success and failure statements in the Contest section below.</p><p id=\"1cf1b90a-e081-810f-8f98-d36d618271c7\"><strong><span>Contest</span></strong></p><p id=\"1cf1b90a-e081-816f-9131-c0722c790628\">The Spell Check the opposing creature makes to cast its Spell is Contested by the Spell Check you make to cast your Spell. When comparing the Spell Checks for the purpose of determining the winner of the Contest, each creature gains a bonus to its Check equal to the MP it spent on its Spell.</p><ul id=\"1cf1b90a-e081-8104-9538-c120531d8e61\" class=\"bulleted-list\"><li><em><strong>Success:</strong></em> The target creature’s Spell fails and has no effect.</li></ul><ul id=\"1cf1b90a-e081-8177-8861-ebe04a87cc20\" class=\"bulleted-list\"><li><em><strong>Failure:</strong></em><em><strong> </strong></em>The target creature’s Spell succeeds and takes effect.</li></ul><ul id=\"1cf1b90a-e081-8191-99a2-d224e1c15600\" class=\"bulleted-list\"><li><em><strong>Tie:</strong></em><em> </em>The target creature’s Spell fails, has no effect, and you each roll on the <strong>Wild Magic Surge Table</strong>. The effect from the table lasts until the end of your next turn.</li></ul><p id=\"1cf1b90a-e081-819b-ba37-c44cf50421a8\" class=\"block-color-default\">Whatever the result, each creature still spends all AP, MP, or other resources they spent to cast their Spell. </p><p id=\"1cf1b90a-e081-8100-aeba-c6c1eea4c6d4\" class=\"block-color-blue_background\"><em><strong>Spell Duel Walkthrough Example:</strong></em> An Enemy says they are casting Scorching Ray at one of your allies. You shout out, “Spell Duel!” You choose your Cone of Cold Spell and are in range of an area between the enemy and your ally. You describe ice blasting out of your hands to try and intercept the fiery projectiles. You then spend 2 AP and choose to spend 3 MP for the Spell Duel. The enemy caster Makes their Spell Check in the same way that they would if you had done nothing. You also make your Spell Check and then both you and the enemy caster get a bonus to your roll equal to the MP spent. You compare your results together and see what happens as both of your magics collide midair.</p><p id=\"1cf1b90a-e081-8127-8a39-de3d0540d898\" class=\"block-color-purple_background\"><strong>DC Tip:</strong> Get creative with your Spells and think of cool descriptions. See the examples below for increasingly creative ways to use your Spells… BUT it’s always at the GM’s discretion. Some of these examples might not be allowed by your GM. The examples below show different ways that the “range requirement” can be met, being in range of either the caster, their targets, or a space between the two.</p><p id=\"1cf1b90a-e081-81f1-a7df-f2fc43bae6cc\" class=\"block-color-blue_background\"><strong>Creative Example 1:</strong> Enemy casts a Lightning Bolt at an ally. You choose your Wall of Earth Spell and are <span>in range of an area between the enemy and your ally.</span> You describe rocks forming a wall between them and your ally attempting to block the lightning.</p><p id=\"1cf1b90a-e081-8125-9d21-dea13f637605\" class=\"block-color-blue_background\"><strong>Creative Example 2:</strong> Enemy casts Poison Cloud at an area. You choose your Gust Spell and are <span>in range of at least one ally inside of the effected area.</span> You describe a rush of wind shooting out from you to blow away the noxious cloud.</p><p id=\"1cf1b90a-e081-8172-8af2-ccdbbe07b2b3\" class=\"block-color-blue_background\"><strong>Creative Example 3:</strong> Enemy casts Disintegrate at an ally. You choose your Dissonant Whispers Spell and are <span>in range of the enemy caster. </span>You describe entering their mind to attempt to give them a hallucination that they already cast the spell.</p><p id=\"1cf1b90a-e081-8135-b73f-c86d34411923\" class=\"block-color-blue_background\"><strong>Creative Example 4:</strong> Enemy casts Fireball at an area. You choose your Calm Emotions Spell and are <span>in range of the enemy caster.</span> You describe attempting to changing their emotions to be chill and relaxed… they don’t want to hurt anyone anymore. Your GM says that makes no sense and you now have to pick some other Spell or the enemies Spell goes off as intended.</p><ul id=\"1cf1b90a-e081-8142-b990-d713e81d352c\" class=\"block-color-default toggle\"><li><details open><summary><strong>Wild Magic Table</strong></summary><table id=\"1cf1b90a-e081-811f-bb0a-fc32695ec200\" class=\"simple-table\"><tbody><tr id=\"1cf1b90a-e081-81e3-b199-fac4ea441efd\"><td id=\"LCQ~\"><strong>d20</strong></td><td id=\"SMC&lt;\">Wild Surge Outcome</td></tr><tr id=\"1cf1b90a-e081-81c0-b09a-d512867e0ecb\"><td id=\"LCQ~\">1</td><td id=\"SMC&lt;\">You turn into a small creature with the stats of a <strong>Sheep </strong>(HP 2, PD 5, Melee Attack +2, Damage 1).</td></tr><tr id=\"1cf1b90a-e081-810f-9555-cddb16fd9321\"><td id=\"LCQ~\">2</td><td id=\"SMC&lt;\">You explode with a magical blast wave.
