        "content": "<p id=\"1cf1b90a-e081-8149-acf8-dc34ff312a0a\">Combat in DC20 is a time when PCs are pushed to their absolute limit; a time when they rise to the occasion, often surprising themselves with what they are capable of doing. The way this is represented mechanically is by allowing players to spend AP in order to apply stacking ADV to significant rolls made during the most dire of situations. This perfectly reflects real life experiences of \"Mother's Strength\" to rescue a child from a car or an athlete's propensity for performing best during the real event instead of in practice. </p><p id=\"1cf1b90a-e081-8104-8020-fd490f60c934\">There are many ways to justify why PCs are more capable and reliable within combat: Adrenaline coursing through their system, pressure to succeed as failure isn't an option, or even excitement and other endorphins fueling their performance or putting them in a state of flow. Regardless of which of these you choose to substantiate this change in success rate, there is one more consideration to keep in mind.</p><p id=\"1cf1b90a-e081-81ce-acfb-de35c9d50db1\">DC20 is a game with mechanics and rules designed to facilitate epic stories and fun moments around the table. Some of those mechanics, like having a higher chance of success to pick a lock in combat, come with a significantly higher risk of failure. Failing to pick a lock outside of combat results in wasted time, repeated attempts, and generally just wasting your time until you either succeed, give up, or get past it in some other manner. Failing to pick a lock within combat often comes at the cost of assisting your allies in winning the combat. There are a number of moments when PCs might be expected to make Checks during combat in DC20 to aid in the victory conditions or ease the combat. Those actions are encouraged and facilitated by the \"1 AP to grant yourself ADV\" rule of combat.</p><p id=\"1cf1b90a-e081-812a-82db-e267534a86aa\" class=\"block-color-purple\">Keep in mind that casting Spells outside of Combat is already accounted for, in that you reduce the cost of Spells outside of Combat (see below). The only time that this benefit isn’t felt is at levels 1 and 2, which I feel is fine since we’re talking about “novice” spellcasters. It makes sense to me that these lower level spellcasters aren’t able to take advantage of this MP reduction (since they have to spend a minimum of 1 MP).</p><p id=\"1cf1b90a-e081-81bd-a5c5-dfb19bbcdd2f\" class=\"block-color-purple_background\">DC Tip: To those that find these explanations, both narrative and mechanical, unsatisfactory, I offer the following simple adjustment: any Check made during Combat has its DC increased by 5. This is still the Beta and this concept of the game will continue to be monitored and polished, but I hope this empowers our GMs to run the game smoothly.</p>",
