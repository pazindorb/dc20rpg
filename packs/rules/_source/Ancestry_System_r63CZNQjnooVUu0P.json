Maybe you choose Dwarf and Elf for your 2 Ancestries. Now you get to decide how they look, which has nothing to do with game mechanics. Maybe you’re a tall slender elf with a huge beard, maybe you’re a thick stocky dwarf with smooth hairless skin and pointy ears, or maybe you look completely like a Dwarf and all of those “Elven Traits” are more recessive and aren’t represented visually. You might have the EYES of an elf, but everything else looks Dwarvish.</p><p id=\"1cf1b90a-e081-8166-9945-f06f64c552e2\" class=\"block-color-purple_background\"><strong>DC Tip:</strong> Maybe you love the Mechanics of a Gnome, but you really want to play a Halfling. Talk to your GM about if it’s ok to completely separate the mechanics of your character from what you visually look like. Work together and brainstorm how your Halfling Character gained the mechanics of a Gnome (through magic, through practice, or etc.).</p><p id=\"1cf1b90a-e081-811a-841b-f94c71b61fd7\">If you wanted to play a Dwarf that had a backstory of being from a long line of Dwarves, you totally can! Pick Dwarf and then ask yourself, “How else do I want to express my Character?” If you’re going to be a Cleric, then maybe look into the Angelborn Traits. If you want to play a brave Dwarf, then maybe look into the Halfling (they have a Halfling Bravery Trait). This doesn’t mean that you are that Ancestry, or that one of your parents were, it’s just a way to further express your character and let them have the Traits that best fit them.</p><p id=\"1cf1b90a-e081-81d5-a7a3-e9bc5960eddc\" class=\"block-color-purple_background\"><strong>DC Tip:</strong> If your ideal Dwarf possess Traits only included in the Giantborn Ancestry list, pick some of those Traits for your “Dwarf” so you can create the character you have in mind. You can describe your Mixed Ancestry character as being a specific kind of Dwarf or a Dwarf/Giantborn hybrid. You can express your Ancestry however you wish.</p>",
