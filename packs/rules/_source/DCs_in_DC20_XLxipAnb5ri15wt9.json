Lockpicking a door, climbing a steep mountain, trying to persuade someone to give you something, or even trying to resist a Spell’s effect over you all have a DC that needs to be met or exceeded in order to succeed.</p><p id=\"2be1b90a-e081-80e3-b5f6-d88002d0b25e\">You always roll a D20 and add whatever relevant modifiers there are based on what the Game Master asks for. Usually (unless you are attacking something) this is going to be a Check or a Save.</p>",

This helps to stay consistent and fair in a GM’s ruling of how difficult something is to accomplish. Below is a chart with a quick reference, and examples are listed below that. These are meant to give Game Masters a foundation to use and players a general expectation to understand. If you want to get more specific, you can set any number you want as the DC. </p><p id=\"2be1b90a-e081-80ae-8236-e317720f840f\" class=\"block-color-purple_background\"><strong>DC Tip: </strong>I personally always have Checks be “by 5’s”, but when it comes to setting a DC for combat related things I use more specific numbers. Things like the DC of a Trap or the DC of sneaking by a particular creature might be something like 12, or 14, or 17.</p><div style=\"display:contents\" dir=\"ltr\"></div><div style=\"display:contents\" dir=\"ltr\"></div><div style=\"display:contents\" dir=\"ltr\"></div><div style=\"display:contents\" dir=\"ltr\"></div><div style=\"display:contents\" dir=\"ltr\"></div><div style=\"display:contents\" dir=\"ltr\"></div><div style=\"display:contents\" dir=\"ltr\"></div><table id=\"2be1b90a-e081-8094-9464-f5eb5437b3cd\" class=\"simple-table\"><tbody><tr id=\"2be1b90a-e081-80e6-ade5-f07b61eea53d\"><td id=\"IWjs\" style=\"width:62px\">DC</td><td id=\"z&lt;Ig\">Task Difficulty</td></tr><tr id=\"2be1b90a-e081-805b-ac9d-ca039bfba42b\"><td id=\"IWjs\" style=\"width:62px\">5</td><td id=\"z&lt;Ig\">Very Easy</td></tr><tr id=\"2be1b90a-e081-8082-ab00-d9a47fe8f2d9\"><td id=\"IWjs\" style=\"width:62px\">10</td><td id=\"z&lt;Ig\">Moderate</td></tr><tr id=\"2be1b90a-e081-80c4-95c0-e0b61df921c4\"><td id=\"IWjs\" style=\"width:62px\">15</td><td id=\"z&lt;Ig\">Hard</td></tr><tr id=\"2be1b90a-e081-8035-a8b0-ecf71d6f679c\"><td id=\"IWjs\" style=\"width:62px\">20</td><td id=\"z&lt;Ig\">Very Hard</td></tr><tr id=\"2be1b90a-e081-8054-a45b-e969689fc054\"><td id=\"IWjs\" style=\"width:62px\">25</td><td id=\"z&lt;Ig\">Extremely Hard</td></tr><tr id=\"2be1b90a-e081-801f-930c-ecaaf4f228a2\"><td id=\"IWjs\" style=\"width:62px\">30</td><td id=\"z&lt;Ig\">Near Impossible</td></tr></tbody></table><p id=\"2be1b90a-e081-80d6-8cd0-c509ee02ffa9\">Most DCs that you’ll ask for will either be 10, 15, or 20. Once PCs reach higher levels and start trying to accomplish crazier and crazier things, a DC 25 or even 30 might come up.</p><ul id=\"2be1b90a-e081-8061-ae45-f489025ad8f9\" class=\"bulleted-list\"><li style=\"list-style-type:disc\">DC 5: This is a Very Easy DC that probably shouldn’t even be asked for and would be easily accomplished by just about anyone, regardless of training. I usually don’t ask for a Check if the DC would be 5.</li></ul><ul id=\"2be1b90a-e081-804b-9f83-eb3f893c79b8\" class=\"bulleted-list\"><li style=\"list-style-type:disc\">DC 10: This is a Moderate DC that should be doable, especially if you’re skilled at the task. Checks that are simple but still have a small chance of failure are a DC 10 for me.</li></ul><ul id=\"2be1b90a-e081-8066-a296-cef923920008\" class=\"bulleted-list\"><li style=\"list-style-type:disc\">DC 15: This is a Hard DC to hit for those who aren’t skilled in this task. If a PC has a decent modifier of a +5 in a Skill, they would have around a 50% chance of success on this. This is my go to DC for when I really don’t know if someone can do it or not and is one step beyond the “moderate” DC of 10.</li></ul><ul id=\"2be1b90a-e081-8083-8f41-d789cc605ca0\" class=\"bulleted-list\"><li style=\"list-style-type:disc\">DC 20: This is a Very Hard DC to hit unless you have training in this Skill. Even PCs with a +10 modifier would hit a DC 20 about 50% of the time. This DC represents something of great worth and something that would be Very Hard. </li></ul><ul id=\"2be1b90a-e081-804f-a88f-e3fa5087c0f2\" class=\"bulleted-list\"><li style=\"list-style-type:disc\">DC 25: This is an Extremely Hard DC to hit. Even if the PC has a +5 in their Skill, they would still need a Nat 20 to just succeed on this DC. I reserve this for things that would be next to impossible at early levels of play, and would only be possible if the character that was attempting to hit this DC both had a good modifier to the roll and rolled well.</li></ul><ul id=\"2be1b90a-e081-806a-b3b9-e435f9627a1f\" class=\"bulleted-list\"><li style=\"list-style-type:disc\">DC 30: This is a Near Impossible DC to hit. It takes a lot for a character to get a +10 in a skill, and even if they did have a +10 they’d still need a Nat 20 to hit this. Reserve this DC for those Checks that are possible for the PC to accomplish, but it’d have to be a “miracle” for it to happen (see Nat 20 and Nat 1 section below for more tips on when to ask for rolls).</li></ul><p id=\"2be1b90a-e081-80f1-80f5-cf66a1d344e5\" class=\"block-color-purple_background\"><strong>DC Tip:</strong> The best way I can describe it is this. If I have a little bit of doubt that a PC could do it, the DC is 10. If there is a decent amount of doubt that they could accomplish this, then the DC is 15. If I am very doubtful that the PC could accomplish this, the DC is 20 and they better roll really high!</p>",

If the DC for climbing a castle wall is 15, a 15 would exactly succeed, but if they beat it by 5 and got a 20 or higher, maybe something cool happens like the guard at the top doesn’t see them at all and they have a moment of surprise! On the other hand, if they got a 10 or lower on that same check (failing it by 5), maybe as they’re climbing the wall they take too long and the guards spot them!</p><p id=\"2be1b90a-e081-8068-815c-ee9c3a0a2134\">This “by 5’s” system also connects to the core of DC20’s Combat system. In Combat, when you roll 5 over the target’s AC you deal more damage than you would normally, so this can also be true for Skill Checks.</p><p id=\"2be1b90a-e081-800d-858b-d44126b8c97e\" class=\"block-color-blue_background\"><strong>Example: </strong>Here is a general outline for what each possible scenario might look like in a given situation. This example is for a DC of 20:<br />14 = Failure<br />15 = Partial Success with a setback (they got close but didn’t hit the DC)<br />20 = Success<br />25 = Major Success (you get some additional benefit)</p><p id=\"2be1b90a-e081-80b6-bbcf-c5f708eb7059\" class=\"block-color-purple_background\"><strong>DC Tip:</strong> You can also do the same for Checks that succeed or fail by 10 or more! I try not to make this be too game altering or punishing, but it’s nice to add some flavor to those extreme rolls.</p>",

Let’s say there’s a scenario where a PC is trying to walk across a simple rickety wooden bridge, the DC for this could be 10 (depending on how rickety it is). Now let’s say it started to rain, or a strong breeze picked up, so you can just dial the DC up by one “notch” to a DC 15! Simple! Then, if you want to add in that the PC is being chased by bandits and needs to hurry across as arrows and people chase them, now it’s a DC 20!</p><p id=\"2be1b90a-e081-8042-800e-cc96d5276d81\">It’s very simple to step the DC up or down depending on extra things that happen around the situation at hand.</p>",

However, when the PCs describe something they do, Game Masters can award Advantage (ADV) or Disadvantage (DisADV) to their roll based on their actions.
