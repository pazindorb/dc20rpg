This serves as the default threshold for most Skill Checks during Combat. Some DC’s might be different than the Encounter DC based on other game mechanics that already have set formulas (i.e. Creatures’ Passive Scores and Defense).</p><p id=\"1cf1b90a-e081-8151-a8fc-d80f4a74e550\" class=\"block-color-blue_background\"><strong>Example:</strong> If a PC is attempting to take the Hide Action, they are trying to beat the Passive Awareness of the enemies. This Passive Awareness could be equal to the Encounter DC, or the GM may decide that certain enemies would have a higher or lower Passive Awareness. This could also be true for picking certain locks or disarming tricky traps.</p><p id=\"1cf1b90a-e081-8150-9519-d78c20682d2d\">The GM may determine that some Skill Checks the PCs attempt during an Encounter are harder or easier than the Encounter DC. This is where a simple “by 5’s” method can quickly shift the difficulty up or down to an Easy or Hard DC.</p><p id=\"1cf1b90a-e081-81ad-a68e-f047ef9812f8\" class=\"block-color-blue\">Easy DC = 5 lower than the Encounter DC</p><p id=\"1cf1b90a-e081-810f-846a-f7f62bab61f7\" class=\"block-color-blue\">Hard DC = 5 higher than the Encounter DC</p><p id=\"1cf1b90a-e081-81f2-88ac-c3ba7b1ac6e5\" class=\"block-color-blue_background\">Example: The GM sets the Encounter DC to 15. This means that when the Barbarian tries to lift the boulder off the ground, the Hunter tries to remember information about a monster, or the Rogue tries to climb up some vines the DC is 15. Alternatively, if picking a certain lock is the key to beating the encounter, the GM might decide this is a Hard DC of 20 (or possibly higher).</p><p id=\"1cf1b90a-e081-817b-b8b6-fcc1649f4669\" class=\"block-color-purple_background\"><strong>DC Tip:</strong> Keep in mind, PCs can help each other find things and grant themselves ADV, so it is possible (through teamwork and AP spent) to hit DC’s that might be more difficult to hit with a straight d20 roll.</p>",

This is established by taking the highest Initiative Check from the PCs and comparing it against the Initiative DC. If this PC’s Initiative Check is equal to or higher than the Initiative DC, then the PC Team wins the Initiative and the PC with the highest Initiative goes first. If the Initiative Check is lower, then the Enemy Team goes first.</p><p id=\"1cf1b90a-e081-819a-afb4-ea5ef88dff89\">Now that the FIRST position is established, the rest of the positions can be filled. After the first PC goes, one of the enemies (of the GM’s choice) takes their turn. It alternates this way, between PCs and enemies, until each PC and enemy has gone once. The positions established during the first round of Combat becomes the Initiative Order for the remainder of Combat. The positions of each team work as follows:</p><figure id=\"1cf1b90a-e081-814f-ac35-e8d202a14234\" class=\"image\"><img src=\"systems/dc20rpg/images/rule-img/Initiative%20Order.png\" /></figure><p id=\"1cf1b90a-e081-8168-a484-fd368d16233f\"><em><strong>PC Team Positions:</strong></em> The PCs automatically fill in each of the PC Team positions based on how high their Initiative Checks were.  The PC with the highest Initiative Check will go first followed by the remaining team members in descending order of their Initiative Check result.</p><p id=\"1cf1b90a-e081-810c-8752-e69a90104612\"><em><strong>Enemy Team Positions:</strong></em> The GM chooses which enemy goes into each of the Enemy Team positions during the first round of combat.
