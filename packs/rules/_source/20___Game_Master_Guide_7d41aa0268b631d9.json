Based on what they\u2019re trying to accomplish, the Skill being used is usually pretty obvious.</p><p><strong><em>Determine the Attribute: </em></strong>Which ATTRIBUTE are they using to accomplish this task?

I challenge you to think of how you could combine each of the 4 Attributes to each of the 13 General Skills. The format for describing these checks is \u201cSkill (Attribute) Check\u201d with the Skill being the first word and the Attribute being used is inside of the parenthesis.</p><p><strong><em>Animal (Might) Check:</em></strong> A PC is wrestling a wild boar.</p><ul><li>Yes this could be an Athletics (Might) Check, and maybe for most characters, that's what it would be. BUT if you have a unique character that has a really high Animal Skill\u2026 it might make more sense for them to use that expertise with animals to their advantage.</li><li>Alternatively, when you try and quickly grab an Animal you could make an Animal (Agility) Check.</li></ul><p><strong><em>Trickery (Charisma) Check:</em></strong> A PC is trying to impersonate the speech or accent of another NPC to try to trick them into thinking they\u2019re someone else.</p><ul><li>Yes this could be an Influence (Charisma) Check, because they\u2019re talking to another NPC to convince them of something\u2026 BUT if a character has put a lot of points into Trickery, it makes sense for this sly character to be able to impersonate people better than most.</li><li>Trying to devise a cunning plan to sneak into a location and infiltrate it you could make a Trickery (Intelligence) Check.</li></ul><p><strong><em>Medicine (Agility) Check: </em></strong>A PC is trying to carefully remove metal shards from an ally.</p><ul><li>Yes, I know Medicine\u2019s \u201chome\u201d is Intelligence\u2026 and I would usually have Medicine Checks be used to see if you KNOW something about things having to do with medicine. BUT this is a careful application of your medical knowledge needing the use of your \u201cagile\u201d hand movements. I could even see someone using a Medicine (Might) Check to perform CPR or jam a dislocated shoulder back into place.</li></ul><p><strong><em>Intimidation (Intelligence) Check:</em></strong> A PC is trying to convince an NPC not to go into the dangerous forests, so they start listing off a bunch of scary facts about how terrifying a beast that lives in this forest is.</p><ul><li>Intimidation can easily be any of the 4 Base Attributes. Breaking something in half would be Might, throwing a dagger right next to someone's head barely missing them would be Agility. When trying to manipulate a creature\u2019s actions using a social threat, extortion, or blackmail, you could make an Intimidation (Charisma) Check. If your threat involves knowledge of key information or about the target specifically you could make an Intimidation (Intelligence) Check.</li></ul><p><strong><em>Insight (Intelligence) Check:</em></strong> A PC is trying to figure out something based on past experiences to put some pieces together. You can think of this as a PC\u2019s intuition.</p>",
