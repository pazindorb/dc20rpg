A Space can be measured in feet or meters, where 1 Space is equal to 5 feet or 1.5 meters. </p><p id=\"2be1b90a-e081-807e-865e-cc93e5d163d8\" class=\"block-color-purple_background\"><strong>DC Tip:</strong> 1 Foot is roughly 30 Centimeters, so you can quickly convert from Feet to Centimeters by multiplying the number of Feet by 30.</p><p id=\"2be1b90a-e081-8034-b03b-c49b5ebb9fab\"><strong>Grid Map</strong> <strong>Distance:</strong> When moving or measuring distance on a gridded map, moving in any direction counts as 1 Space (including moving diagonally). You can alternatively measure in straight lines between points if you have the measuring tools or templates to do so. </p><p id=\"2be1b90a-e081-80be-b19d-dd6ca046add6\" class=\"block-color-blue_background\"><strong>Example: </strong>The normal range of a Longbow is 30 Spaces. To determine its range on a Grid Map just count 30 Spaces in any direction. The Longbow’s range could also be expressed as 150ft or 45m.</p><p id=\"2be1b90a-e081-8057-8fd6-def05e726008\">When tracking distance across long distances, such as from one town to another, you might want to measure distance using feet or meters instead. </p><p id=\"2be1b90a-e081-80a6-bd9d-ea1f91bb394f\" class=\"block-color-purple_background\"><strong>DC Tip:</strong> Using Spaces to track distance in Combat makes things easier for determining how far a creature can move or the range of an effect. If something has a range of 10 Spaces, then that’s 10 Spaces on the Grid Map.</p>",
