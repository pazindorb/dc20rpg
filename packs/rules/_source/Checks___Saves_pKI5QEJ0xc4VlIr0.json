When this happens, an Attack Check or Spell Check is ALWAYS made to determine DAMAGE… while a Save is ALWAYS made against the EFFECT. This opens up many very interesting interactions on what the outcome will be and keeps things moving quickly because both the Attacker and the Target make these rolls at the same time (similar to how Contested Checks work). With Dynamic Attack Saves, you don’t have to wait for the Attack Check to hit, then have the target make a Save, they both happen at the same time.</p>",
