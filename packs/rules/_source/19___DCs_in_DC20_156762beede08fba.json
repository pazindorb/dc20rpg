If a PC has a decent modifier of a +5 in a Skill, they would have around a 50% chance to succeed on this. This is my \u201cgo to DC\u201d for when I REALLY don\u2019t know if someone can do it or not and is one step beyond the \u201cmoderate\u201d DC of 10.</li></ul><ul><li><strong><em>DC 20:</em></strong>This is a Very Hard DC to hit unless you have training in this Skill. Even PCs with a +10 modifier would hit a DC 20 about 50% of the time. This DC represents something of great worth and something that would be \u201cVery Hard\u201d.</li><li><strong><em>DC 25:</em></strong>This is an Extremely Hard DC to hit. Even if the PC has a +5 in their skill, they would need a Nat 20 to even succeed on this DC. I reserve this for things that would be next to impossible at early levels of play, and would ONLY be possible if the character that was attempting to hit this DC BOTH had a good modifier to the roll AND rolled well.</li><li><strong><em>DC 30:</em></strong>This is a Near Impossible DC to hit. It takes a LOT for a character to get a +10 in a skill\u2026 and even if they did have a +10\u2026 they would still need a Nat 20 to hit this\u2026 that is CRAZY. Reserve this DC for those checks that are possible for the PC to accomplish\u2026 but it\u2019d have to be a \u201cmiracle\u201d for it to happen (see Nat 20 and Nat 1 section below for more tips on when to ask for rolls).</li></ul><div class=\"book-block book-block-dctip>The best way I can describe it is this: if I have a little bit of doubt that a PC could do it, the DC is 10\u2026 if there is a decent amount of doubt that they could accomplish this, then the DC is 15\u2026 but if I am VERY doubtful that the PC could accomplish this, the DC is 20 and they better roll really high!</div>",
