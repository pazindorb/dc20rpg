Maybe you choose Dwarf and Elf for your 2 Ancestries. Now you get to decide how they look, which has nothing to do with game mechanics. Maybe you’re a tall slender elf with a huge beard, maybe you’re a thick stocky dwarf with smooth hairless skin and pointy ears, or maybe you look completely like a Dwarf and all of those “Elven Traits” are more recessive and aren’t represented visually. You might have the EYES of an elf, but everything else looks Dwarvish.</p><p id=\"2be1b90a-e081-814f-8f4c-ec4b62ce6997\" class=\"block-color-purple_background\"><strong>DC Tip:</strong> Maybe you love the Mechanics of a Gnome, but you really want to play a Halfling. Talk to your GM about if it’s ok to completely separate the mechanics of your character from what you visually look like. Work together and brainstorm how your Halfling Character gained the mechanics of a Gnome (through magic, through practice, or etc.).</p><p id=\"2be1b90a-e081-818c-9ca7-c438dedc6d77\">If you wanted to play a Dwarf that had a backstory of being from a long line of Dwarves, you totally can! Pick Dwarf and then ask yourself, “How else do I want to express my Character?” If you’re going to be a Cleric, then maybe look into the Angelborn Traits. If you want to play a brave Dwarf, then maybe look into the Halfling (they have a Halfling Bravery Trait). This doesn’t mean that you are that Ancestry, or that one of your parents were, it’s just a way to further express your character and let them have the Traits that best fit them.</p><p id=\"2be1b90a-e081-81d9-9bb9-c3f4490b85e1\" class=\"block-color-purple_background\"><strong>DC Tip:</strong> If your ideal Dwarf possess Traits only included in the Giantborn Ancestry list, pick some of those Traits for your “Dwarf” so you can create the character you have in mind. You can describe your Mixed Ancestry character as being a specific kind of Dwarf or a Dwarf/Giantborn hybrid. You can express your Ancestry however you wish.</p>",

With this rule, you can choose from any of the Ancestry Traits and give yourself a “magic item” that represents that power. You can do this multiple times for multiple points worth of traits. You can tie all these points into a single item or into multiple items. </p><p id=\"2be1b90a-e081-8197-8bfc-f6c2e413a423\" class=\"block-color-blue_background\"><strong>Example:</strong> You want to play a “normal” Human PC, but you REALLY want to have a Breath Weapon (from the Dragonborn Ancestry) and don’t want to say that you’re part Dragonborn. You can create a Human with 3 points spent in the Human Ancestry, then with the other 2 points you can get the Dragonborn’s Breath Weapon but describe that it comes from a “magic ring” on your finger. This allows you to play the fantasy of a human while still having the magical abilities that you want.</p><p id=\"2be1b90a-e081-81bf-b8b3-f98f4aba3dce\" class=\"block-color-purple_background\"><strong>DC Tip:</strong> I’ve done this myself with Class Features before. I had a PC who was a complete commoner, but he happened to find a magic sword. As soon as he picked it up he was granted the powers of a Spellblade. If I ever lost the sword, then those powers were gone. It’s a very unique way to make a unique PC. </p>",
