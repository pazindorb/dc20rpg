The way this is represented mechanically is by allowing players to spend AP in order to apply stacking ADV to significant rolls made during the most dire of situations. This perfectly reflects real life experiences of a \u201cmother's strength\u201d to rescue her child from a car or an athlete's propensity for performing best during the real event instead of in practice.</p><p>There are many ways to justify why PCs are more capable and reliable within combat: adrenaline coursing through their system, pressure to succeed as failure isn't an option, or even excitement and other endorphins fueling their performance or putting them in a state of flow. Regardless of which of these you choose to substantiate this change in success rate, there\u2019s one more consideration to keep in mind.</p><p>DC20 is a game with mechanics and rules designed to facilitate epic stories and fun moments around the table. Some of those mechanics, like having a higher chance of success to pick a lock in combat, come with a significantly higher risk of failure. Failing to pick a lock outside of combat results in wasted time, repeated attempts, and generally just wasting your time until you either succeed, give up, or get past it in some other manner. Failing to pick a lock within combat often comes at the cost of assisting your allies in winning the combat. There are a number of moments when PCs might be expected to make Checks during combat in DC20 to aid in the victory conditions or ease the combat. Those actions are encouraged and facilitated by the \"1 AP to grant yourself ADV\" rule of combat.</p><p>Finally, keep in mind that casting Spells outside of Combat is already accounted for in that you reduce the cost of Spells outside of Combat (see below). The only time that this benefit is not felt is at levels 1 and 2, which I also feel is fine since we\u2019re talking about \u201cnovice\u201d spellcasters, so it makes sense to me that these lower-level spellcasters aren\u2019t able to take advantage of this MP reduction (since they have to still spend a minimum of 1 MP).</p><div class=\"book-block book-block-dctip>To those that find these explanations, both narrative and mechanical, unsatisfactory, I offer the following simple adjustment: any Check made during combat has its DC increased by 5. This is still the Beta and this concept of the game will continue to be monitored and polished, but I hope this empowers our GMs on how to run the game smoothly.</div>"}, "video": {"controls": true, "volume": 0.5}, "src": null, "ownership": {"default": -1, "dOcXwrUs2VunZl0y": 3}, "flags": {}, "_stats": {"compodiumSource": null, "duplicateSource": null, "coreVersion": "12.327", "systemId": "dc20rpg", "systemVersion": "0.8.0", "createdTime": 1721332009.299054, "modifiedTime": 1721332009.299054, "lastModifiedBy": "dOcXwrUs2VunZl0y"}, "_key": "!journal.pages!ad29f4ea314ac6c7.8906daff24204786"}, {"sort": 5, "name": "Mana Points", "type": "text", "_id": "7e2869b7032e4771", "system": {}, "title": {"show": true, "level": 1}, "image": {}, "text": {"format": 1, "content": "<p>Spellcasting PCs have Mana Points (MP) which can be spent on Spells, Spell Enhancements, Class Features, and Ancestry Traits.</p><p><strong><em>Gaining Maximum MP:</em></strong> You can gain MP from the Spellcasting Mastery Feature granted by Spellcasting Classes (Cleric, Sorcerer, Wizard, etc.), from Talents (such as the Multiclassing Talents), or from Ancestry Features.</p><p><strong><em>Regaining MP:</em></strong> You regain all MP when you finish a Long Rest.</p>"}, "video": {"controls": true, "volume": 0.5}, "src": null, "ownership": {"default": -1, "dOcXwrUs2VunZl0y": 3}, "flags": {}, "_stats": {"compodiumSource": null, "duplicateSource": null, "coreVersion": "12.327", "systemId": "dc20rpg", "systemVersion": "0.8.0", "createdTime": 1721332009.299054, "modifiedTime": 1721332009.299054, "lastModifiedBy": "dOcXwrUs2VunZl0y"}, "_key": "!journal.pages!ad29f4ea314ac6c7.7e2869b7032e4771"}, {"sort": 6, "name": "MP Outside of Combat", "type": "text", "_id": "c6b3d8d1f738c2d8", "system": {}, "title": {"show": true, "level": 2}, "image": {}, "text": {"format": 1, "content": "<p>When you spend MP outside of Combat, the cost is reduced by 1 (minimum of 1).
